## NFT Flow

### 1. Minting NFTs

**Process:**
1. User A creates a skill listing
2. User B proposes a trade
3. User A accepts the proposal
4. Both users complete their parts of the exchange
5. When `markBarterCompleted` is called, NFTs are automatically minted
6. Each user receives an NFT as proof of the exchange

**Smart Contract:**
- `BarterCompleted` event emitted with `nftId1` and `nftId2`
- Uses Hedera Token Service (HTS) for NFT minting
- NFTs stored on-chain with metadata

### 2. Viewing NFTs

**Process:**
1. NFTs are automatically tracked by the contract
2. `getUserNFTs(address)` returns all user's NFT IDs
3. Frontend displays NFTs with metadata
4. Users can view details, list for sale, or trade

### 3. Trading NFTs (UI Ready)

**Process:**
1. User lists NFT for sale with a price
2. Other users browse marketplace
3. User clicks "Buy" to purchase
4. Transaction processed through smart contract

**Note:** Contract functions for listing and buying need to be added to enable full trading functionality.
